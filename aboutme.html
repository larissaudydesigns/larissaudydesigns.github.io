    <div class="aboutmecontent">
        I am a recent graduate from Brigham Young University - Idaho as a BA Graphic Design major. Growing up I always
        had a special place in my heart for art. I want to help others find this same passion like others have done for
        me.

        When I am making art, I enjoy making things that make people think. When people look at my art I
        want them to be able to feel the emotion and story they see in the art and relate personally to it.

        â€‹I'm a hard-working, passionate, and devoted individual who loves to work with others!
