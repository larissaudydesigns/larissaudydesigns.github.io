        <div class="description">
            For this project I created a passion project with a document that is important to me. My goal was to use the
            principles of design to create something that was simple and had a kind of modern feel to it. Something that
            you can hang up in your home. I decided to have the phrases that were important in bold so that they stand
            out when the viewer is reading them and also so if they are scanning it looking for a specific part they
            will be able to easily find it.
